    const newDOM = document.createRange().createContextualFragment(newMarkup);
    /* document.createRange(): Creates a new Range object. A Range represents a fragment of a document that can contain nodes and parts of text nodes.
    createContextualFragment(htmlString): This method is called on a Range object. It takes a string of HTML (in this case, newMarkup) and converts it into a DOM fragment.
    This fragment is a full-fledged part of the DOM but exists in memory and isn't part of the actual document's structure until it's inserted somewhere in the document.
    
    Initialization: You create a Range by calling document.createRange(). At this point, the range is conceptually positioned but doesnâ€™t highlight or select anything specific unless you define its start and end points.
    Fragment Creation: When you call createContextualFragment() with an HTML string, the method parses this string as if it were part of the document at the location specified by the Range. This parsing respects the document's structure and formatting rules.
    DOM Fragment: The parsed HTML string becomes a DocumentFragment, which is a lightweight, document-like object that can hold DOM nodes in the same way a full document can, but it does so without being directly part of the main document tree until explicitly inserted.
    Storing in newDOM: The resulting DOM fragment is stored in the variable newDOM. This DOM fragment can now be used for various purposes, such as comparing with the existing DOM on the page or being inserted into the document at a desired location.

    We're essentially preparing a chunk of HTML text to be dynamically manipulated or compared with the current content of the webpage without affecting the visible page until you decide to insert or replace elements.
    This method is particularly useful for updating parts of a webpage with new content without reloading the entire page, allowing for more efficient and smoother user experiences in dynamic web applications. */

    //Now we can select all elements within our new DOM that we created by generating the new markup containing the updated text and attributes. Basically, we are selecting all elements of the DOM with the updated information (the DOM that would have been rendered if we had just called the render() method)
    //Recall that querySelectorAll returns a NodeList, so let's convert this to an array using Array.from
    const newElements = Array.from(newDOM.querySelectorAll('*'));

    //So now we can compare this updated DOM with our current DOM. First, we need to get all the elements of our current DOM (meaning all of the elements within our current _parentElement), and we will update the text and attributes within these elements
    //within our current _parentElement to our new _parentElement

    //Note that this name is a bit misleading as it's actually a NodeList, where each "Node" is actually each of our child elements within the _parentElement. This is because all elements are nodes. However, not all nodes are elements so this can get a bit confusing.
    const currElements = Array.from(this._parentElement.querySelectorAll('*'));

    //Now, let's compare between the elements in our new DOM and our current DOM
    newElements.forEach((newEl, i) => {
      const currEl = currElements[i];

      //There is a method on all nodes that allows us to compare between two nodes called isEqualNode, so we will use that. Note that this is not comparing memory references, this is comparing the actual content of the nodes
      //However this name is a bit misleading as it does compare between the nodes in our _parentElement, but it also compares the child elements within our current and new _parentElement
      if (
        !currEl.isEqualNode(newEl) &&
        currEl.firstChild?.nodeValue.trim() !== ''
      ) {
        //Since we are updating our servings, our text elements will differ in servings as the servings in our state has changed. However, this will be limited to +/- 1 as we also need to update the dataset property (the 'data-*' attribute) within our markup.
        //What's happening is that the value that we pass into our handler (the updateTo value in our RecipeView) +/- 1 due to the button click, but we are not actually re-rendering and saving this updated value anywhere.
        //So, we will do this in our second if block.

        //However, first, we are going to render this new servings value on the DOM.

        //However, note that this also notices in the parent elements that the entire container elements are different due to the underlying nodes of the servings being different, which we will handle later.

        //So, over here we will say that if the current element is different than our new element, we will change the text node of the current element to the text node of the new element
        currEl.textContent = newEl.textContent; //Note that currEl is the DOM element that is currently on the page, so we do want to mutate the text node within this element
        //Note that just doing the above will not work as we would be replacing the text node for every current element that does not equal our new element, including the text node within the parent container.
        //This would cause the entire text node in the parent container to equal the text node of our new element.
        //To avoid this, we need to find a way to determine if the element within our parentElement only contains a text node, without any other children elements, as we know that that's what we're looking to re-render in this case.
        //And that's what would differentiate this element from others within our parentElement in this situation.

        //We can do this by adjusting a node property called nodeValue.
        //The value of nodeValue will be null if the node is an element, amongst many others (you can refer to the doc), but the main point is that if it's a text node, then we can extract that text content value of the text node.
        //So, with this in mind, we should check to ensure that the elements are different, but on top of that, we also only want elements that only contain a child element containing a text node.
        //So, we can take the first child of the element since we know that the only child in the element should contain the text node, so if we check the nodeValue property of this text node, it should return something meaning it should not be an empty string or return null.
        //We can check this on either the currEl or the newEl, it doesn't matter as the indexes are matching. The point is that we find the element containing only the servings text node, and we modify this.
        //We use optional chaining to ensure that it's not null meaning that if the first child doesn't exist, then we just short circuit and returns undefined instead of throwing an error
        //We also trim to filter the elements which don't have a first child element containing a text node because the nodeValue of such elements will be a string consisting of white space, such as ('\n')
        //However, the parent elements with a first child element containing a text node will pass this condition as there will be some content left after trimming white space.

        /* The phenomenon where the first child element appears to be just whitespace is a common occurrence in HTML documents, primarily due to how HTML is formatted by developers for readability.
        When developers create HTML, they often format it with indentations and line breaks to make the code easier to read and manage.
        These formatting choices, while invisible on the rendered page, become part of the DOM as text nodes. */

        //So, we just updated the servings displayed on the DOM based on the new servings

        //Now we want to update the dataset properties:
        if (!currEl.isEqualNode(newEl)) {
          //We can access the attributes property, which all elements have. newEl.attributes, for example, will return an object of all of the attributes that have changed.
          //So, we will convert this object to an array and basically copy all of the attributes from our new element to our current element, updating our DOM

          Array.from(newEl.attributes).forEach(attr => {
            currEl.setAttribute(attr.name, attr.value); //if the elements aren't equal, we take the attributes of the updated parentElement of our DOM and copy them over to the current parentElement of our DOM
            //setAttribute: We are taking the name of our attribute that's updated (in this case, it would be update-to) and we are updating the value tied to this name to the updated value that we get from our new element (parentElement)
